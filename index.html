        <p>Clay stands tall with a heart so bright,
            A mind like fire, sharp with light.
            Strength in soul and wisdom keen,
            The kindest heart you've ever seen.

            Through every trial, he holds his ground,
            A friend so true, so deep, profound.
            Beauty shines in all he does,
            A force of will, a heart that loves.
            No storm could shake, no doubt dismay
            The world is better with Clay.</p>
