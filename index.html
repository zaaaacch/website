            Clay stands tall with a heart so bright,<br>
            A mind like fire, sharp with light.<br>
            Strength in soul and wisdom keen,<br>
            The kindest heart you've ever seen.<br>
            <br>
            Through every trial, he holds his ground,<br>
            A friend so true, so deep, profound.<br>
            Beauty shines in all he does,<br>
            A force of will, a heart that loves.<br>
            No storm could shake, no doubt dismay<br>
            The world is better with Clay.
